Installation Techinques:
For now it would be best to this downaload this mod and build into your copy of Cities: Skylines
If unsure how to do that, it might be best to wait until this mod is in the steam workshop

Once you have the mod installed you will need to update the settings for this mod so that it knows how to interact with your twitch channel. The only "dynamic" value here will be your OAuth Password which you can obtain by accessing https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ (may require you messing around with your twitch dev account)
